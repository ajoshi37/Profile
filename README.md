<h2>About yourself</h2>
<hr>
Hello, Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening or Night
I am Graduate Student from Illinois Instituate of Technology with Master's Degree in Computer & Information Security (CyberSecurity).Looking to hack into the Cybersecurity world. I like to explore new technology and security related things. If i'm not doing that than i will be outside enjoying life, basketball and nature. I also like to explore new places and resturants but from 6 feet apart. 

At the end of the day, the goals are simple: safety and security.
